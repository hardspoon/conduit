# Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Setup

We are deploying a Next.js application with a PostgreSQL database on Railway. The setup consists of two services:

1. **conduit** - The Next.js application service
2. **Postgres** - The PostgreSQL database service

## What We're Trying to Accomplish

Our goal is to:
1. Deploy the Next.js application to Railway
2. Connect it to a PostgreSQL database
3. Ensure proper environment variable sharing between services
4. Set up automatic deployments

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed
- Next.js app router setup
- Prisma schema and initial migration
- NextAuth.js configuration
- Basic API routes for articles
- TypeScript types and interfaces
- Environment variable configuration

### In Progress
- Article route TypeScript implementation
- Service linking between Next.js and PostgreSQL
- Deployment configuration

## What We've Tried

### 1. Initial Database Setup
- Added PostgreSQL service using `railway add`
- Generated and ran initial Prisma migrations
- Configured DATABASE_URL in the local environment

### 2. Service Configuration Attempts
- Created railway.toml for deployment configuration
- Attempted to link services using various approaches:
  ```toml
  [deploy.envs]
  DATABASE_URL = "${POSTGRES_DATABASE_URL}"
  ```
  ```toml
  [deploy.envs]
  DATABASE_URL = "${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}"
  ```

### 3. Service Linking
- Used `railway service` to switch between services
- Attempted to link services using Railway CLI
- Tried referencing Postgres variables in the conduit service

### 4. TypeScript Implementation
- Working on proper typing for article routes
- Implementing interface definitions for API responses
- Setting up proper error handling with types

## Current Issues

1. **Service Communication**: Difficulty in properly linking the PostgreSQL service variables to the Next.js application
2. **Environment Variables**: Challenges in sharing DATABASE_URL between services
3. **Build Process**: Need to ensure Prisma generates properly during build
4. **TypeScript Errors**: Need to resolve remaining type issues in article routes

## Potential Next Steps

1. **Manual Variable Setup**:
   - Set DATABASE_URL directly in Railway dashboard
   - Verify variable sharing between services

2. **Alternative Service Structure**:
   - Consider combining services into a single service
   - Use Railway's shared variable feature

3. **Build Process Improvements**:
   - Modify build command to ensure proper Prisma setup
   - Add pre-build database migration step

4. **TypeScript Improvements**:
   - Complete article route type definitions
   - Implement proper error handling types
   - Add response type interfaces

5. **Documentation Review**:
   - Review Railway's latest documentation on service linking
   - Check for updated best practices

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Switch between services
railway service

# Check current variables
railway variables

# Link project
railway link

# Deploy application
railway up

# Generate Prisma types
npx prisma generate

# Run Prisma migrations
npx prisma migrate dev
```
